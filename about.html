        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Josh. I do Youtube, Tech Related Things, and Random Stuff.</p>

        <p><br>I try programming, but I'm not very good at it. </p>
        <p>If you're curious, I <i>"know what i'm doing"</i> when it comes to things like Youtube and HTML (hense coding this website) but not much else.  I use Windows 10 and occasionaly Ubuntu or Linux on a virtual machine . There quite good but i'm pretty much unwilling to learn anything better (like Mac OS).</p>
        <p><br>I play a lot of games, i have more games on PC than PS4 but i still like the consoles.I used to have an Xbox but got bored of it so now im into PlayStation and PC games.I also like to play table-top RPG's like 'Dungeons And Dragons'. I like to play smaller games like 'Hello Neighbour' and 'Team Fortress 2' but i will occasionally play larger games like 'Paladins' and then eventually play bigger games like CS:GO.</p>

        <p><br>I do enjoy creating YouTube videos, but nothing professional-grade; I just use OBS or create with my Point-and-Shoot Camera.</p>


        <h2 style="margin-top: 1em">This Site</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>It's designed to be as clean as possible. Hence the very basic colour scheme.</li>
        <li>I like animations, that's why things do other things when you put your cursor on them.</li>
        <li>It's hosted on GitHub pages and proxied with CloudFlare, so it's needlessly fast (Under 500ms in most cases).</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 1em">Anyway, that's pretty much it. If there's anything you think I should add here, feel free to tell me on my Discord...</p>
